## Get access to IBM Watson
AutoMash needs a text to speech interface to work, currently it can only use IBM Watson. For this you need a free account which will allow you to transform 500 minutes of audio into text for free.

1. Register [here](https://cloud.ibm.com/registration). Sometimes account creation fails, this seems to be a faulty IBM anti fraud measure it helps to try different email addresses, private browsing / incognito mode mode or different browsers. For me it worked under Firefox with private browsing and a gmail address.
2. Go to the tutorial [here](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-gettingStarted) and follow the pointrts under `IBM CloudÂ® only` to get the API key and URL.
3. Create a file called `watson.key` that has the shape
```
Url
API Key
```

Now you have finished installing AutoMash.
